#summary Gyro is used to sense the angular rate of rotation of the robot.

= Introduction =

The gyro is used to sense the angular rate of rotation of the robot. We will use this sensor to detect if we are turning and how much we have turned. When combined with the accelerometer and encoders it is possible for us to determine are position on the field from our known starting position (we may not implement this).
