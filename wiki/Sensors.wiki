=Sensors=
This page will describe and link to documents about each Sensor that we will use on the robot. This should allow are programmers to gather data about our control system and make the most robust code for the robot.

Please add new sensor information as you see fit.

== Ultrasonic Sonar Sensors==

We will be using sonar sensors to detect the distance the robot is away form the driver station wall and away from the feeding lane wall.

This should allow to easily align the robot up to a scoring position on each peg.

=== Details ===

I think we will need to use the Maxbotix sonars to be able to not read the floor at distances of 9ft and only 5ins from the ground. Scott at Maxbotix is releasing a paper tomorrow about performance close to a ground but he has confirmed that the 1240's should be able to perform the task that we need.
