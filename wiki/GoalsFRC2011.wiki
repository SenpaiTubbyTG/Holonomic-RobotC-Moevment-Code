#summary The DiscoBots Programming goals for the 2011 FRC Logomotion season

= Goals =

==Week 1:==
 # ~~Reimage Classmate~~
 # ~~Reimage cRIO and redownload code to 2010 robot~~
 # Sensor setup and output:
  * ~~Gyro~~
  * Accelerometer
  * Quadrature Encoder
  * Light Sensor
  * Ultrasonic Rangefinder (may move to week 2)



==Week 2:==
 # PID control loop for gyro turning to set degrees (90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc.)
 # PID control loop for gyro to drive strait and hold orientation. 
  * When driving the robot stays strait, when not moving, if twisted the robot will try to reorient back to it's original position)
 # PID control loop for encoder-based velocity control 
  * When velocity set to zero the robot would try to stay still by pushing back in any direction that it is pushed
 # Class structure for holonomic drive control
 # Holonomic Drive
 # Basic Line Following for 6 wheeled robot

==Week 3:==
 # Senor based drive control
  * Testing the ability of the drive train to drive strait and be controlled.
