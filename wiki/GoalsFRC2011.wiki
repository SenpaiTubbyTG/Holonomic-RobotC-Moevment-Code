#summary The DiscoBots Control goals for the 2011 FRC Logomotion season

= Goals =

==Week 1:==
 # ~~Reimage Classmate~~
 # ~~Reimage cRIO and redownload code to 2010 robot~~
 # Sensor setup and output:
  * ~~Gyro~~
  * Accelerometer
  * Quadrature Encoder
  * Light Sensor
  * Ultrasonic Rangefinder (may move to week 2)
 # Research Sensor algorithms and uses
 # Design Electronic Layout for Robot
  * ~~Paper layout design~~
  * CAD layout of electronics
  * Battery mount designed


==Week 2:==
 # control loop for gyro turning to set degrees (90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc.)
 # control loop for gyro to drive strait and hold orientation. 
  * When driving the robot stays strait, when not moving, if twisted the robot will try to reorient back to it's original position)
 # control loop for encoder-based velocity control 
  * When velocity set to zero the robot would try to stay still by pushing back in any direction that it is pushed
 # Holonomic Drive
  * Class structure for holonomic drive control
  * Able to tell the robot a direction, power, and a twist and have it perform that output
 # Basic Line Following for 6 wheeled robot
  * Mount designed for Six Wheel Protobot
  * Code written for VEX microcontroller
 # Electronic Board created with parts mounted
  * Battery mount created
 # Power Wires are routed and labeled on the board

==Week 3:==
 # Senor based drive control
  * Testing the ability of the drive train to drive strait and be controlled easily.
 # Lift control
  * Sense Different Lift Positions
 # Ultrasonic Ranger Positioning
  * Able to tell the distance from each of the three sides of the robot

==Week 4:==
 # Ultrasonic Ranger Orienting
  * Robot is able to use two rangers on the front of the robot to make sure it is oriented strait to the wall
 # Continue to improve the driver control of the robot

==Week 5:==
