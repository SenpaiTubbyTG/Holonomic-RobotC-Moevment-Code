#summary The DiscoBots Control goals for the 2011 FRC Logomotion season

= Goals =

==Week 1:==
 # ~~Reimage Classmate~~
 # ~~Reimage cRIO and redownload code to 2010 robot~~
 # Sensor setup and output:
  * ~~Gyro~~
  * Accelerometer
  * Quadrature Encoder
  * Light Sensor
  * [Sonars Sonar Rangefinder] (may move to week 2)
 # Research Sensor algorithms and uses
 # Design Electronic Layout for Robot
  * ~~Paper layout design~~
  * ~~CAD layout of electronics~~
  * Battery mount designed


==Week 2:==
 # control loop for gyro to drive strait and hold orientation. 
  * When driving the robot stays strait, when not moving, if twisted the robot will try to reorient back to it's original position)
  * Test on 2010 Robot
 # control loop for gyro turning to set degrees (90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc.)
  * Test on 2010 Robot
 # control loop for encoder-based velocity control 
  * When velocity set to zero the robot would try to stay still by pushing back in any direction that it is pushed
  * All wheels should spin at the same rate
 # Holonomic Drive
  * Class structure for holonomic drive control
  * Able to tell the method an x vector, y vector, and a twist and have it calculate each wheels velocity
  * Able to tell the method a magnitude, a direction and a twist and have it calculate each wheels velocity
 # Protobot
  * Code written for VEX Cortex
  * Basic Line Following for 6 wheeled robot
  * Line Tracking Mount designed and built
  * Can drive and control lift
 # Electronic Board created with parts mounted
  * Battery mount created
  * Sensor Mounts created
    * Sonars Mounted
    * Encoders Mounted on drive motors
    * Gyro and Accelerometer Mounted
 # Power Wires are routed and labeled on the board

==Week 3:==
 # Drive control
  * Have drive modes that limit top speed and increase sensitivity for fine drive movements
  * Test on 2010 Robot
 # Lift control programmed
  * encoder mounted on lift motor
  * uses encoder to tell lift position
  * two limit switches for full up and full down
 # Claw control programmed
 # Sonar Ranger Positioning
  * Able to tell the distance from each of the three sides of the robot
 # Protobot
  * Able to track line and stop when line ends
  * Able to detect branch in the line and follow one of the branches
  * Programmed for the VEX microcontroller

==Week 4:==
 # Mount cRIO on the new robot
 # Driver Control
  * Testing the ability of the drive train to drive strait and be controlled easily
  * Tweak PID parameters and get everything working really tight
 # Sonar Orienting
  * Robot is able to use two sonars on the front of the robot to make sure it is oriented strait to the wall

==Week 5:==
 # Automatically position itself in front of any peg and hang the tube
 # Autonomously hang tube on top rung (Strait ahead)

==Week 6:==
 # Autonomously hang tube on top run from middle position
 # Lots of Driver Practice
